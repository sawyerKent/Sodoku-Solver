# Sudoku-Solver

This is a sudoku solver that I created using Python and the Pygame library. It uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the sudoku puzzle. Pygram was used to create a GUI that shows the puzzle being solved, allowing the algorithm to be visualized. This sudoku solver is also a playable game. The user can solve the puzzle on their own or they can press the space bar to let the algorithm solve the rest.
